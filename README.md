Aroo, the lightweight web framework
===================================

Aroo is a lightweight web framework intended to support the development of
ArooCMS, the CMS to end all CMSs. It may eventually become a general-purpose
lightweight web framework that can be used to develop other applications, but
at the moment its main purpose is the development of ArooCMS.

Aroo integrates a number of different open-source projects, and implements a
lot of ideas taken from here and there. For proper credits, look into the code.
